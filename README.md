snopt-python
================

This package provides Python support for the nonlinear optimization code SNOPT.  This package does not include the SNOPT libraries, only the python interface.

Note: Use this interface at your own risk.  I haven't had the time to do a lot of testing on it yet.

Branches:
- master       includes both SNOPT and DNOPT interface (so both libraries have to be present)
- snopt-only   for SNOPT only
- dnopt-only   for DNOPT only 

To use:
Set the environment variable SNOPT7LIB to the location of your SNOPT libraries, for example, the following commands assume your SNOPT Fortran libraries are in a directory called "lib" in your home directory:
```
export SNOPT7LIB=$HOME/lib
```

Build, install,
```
python setup.py build
python setup.py install --user
```

Run an example:
```
python dieta.py
```
